## 0.7.0

New tasks:

* `relative_roots` configuration key moved to `search.relative_roots`, deprecation warning (removed in the next minor).

## 0.5.4

* `i18n-tasks irb` for debugging
* This release is a major refactoring to use real trees internally (as opposed to nested hashes).
Real trees allow for much easier [traversal](/lib/i18n/tasks/data/tree/traversal.rb).
With these trees, information can be associated with each node, which allows for things like the conservative router.
* Accept keys with dashes (`-`) [#64](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks/issues/64).
